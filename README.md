Delay Filter Alpha 3 Plugin

I still need to make a readme for this it is GPL 3 Juce and VST3 license terms. I will update these when I am done with this concept.

Note that to hear this plugin well put mix at position 1.0 which is fully wet, vs the default 0.5 (mixed wet/dry).

A versatile multi-mode audio filter plugin built with JUCE 8.0.9, emulating classic filter behaviors using delay-based interference principles. Inspired by signal processing concepts like comb filtering, FIR/IIR designs, and phase modulation, it offers adjustable frequency targeting across modes.This plugin is designed for VST3 hosts and supports stereo I/O. It's perfect for sound design, mixing, and experimental audio processing.FeaturesMulti-Mode Filtering:Comb: Delay-based notches and peaks for metallic/resonant tones.
FIR: Multi-tap feedforward with Hann windowing for smooth, linear-phase filtering.
IIR: Biquad-based (Low-pass, High-pass, Band-pass) with Q/resonance control.
Phaser: All-pass stages with frequency-dependent modulation for sweeping notches.
Flanger: Modulated delay comb for dynamic sweeps.

Frequency Tuning: Unified "Filter Freq" knob (20 Hzâ€“20 kHz) targets the core response in each mode (e.g., cutoff for IIR, notch spacing for Comb/FIR).
Modulation: LFO rate/depth for Phaser/Flanger sweeps.
Mix & Feedback: Blend dry/wet and add resonance/echo.
Smoothing: Parameter changes are smoothed to prevent zipper noise.
Linear Interpolation: Smooth delay reads for artifact-free processing.

UsageFilter Type: Select mode from dropdown.
Filter Freq: Tune the target frequency (Hz) for the filter's response.
IIR-Specific (in IIR mode): Choose type (Low/High/Band-pass) and adjust Q for sharpness.
Delay-Based Modes (Comb/FIR/Flanger): Use Delay (ms) for base timing; Filter Freq auto-adjusts spacing.
Modulation: Enable LFO Rate/Depth for Phaser/Flanger.
Mix: 0% = dry (bypass), 100% = full effect.

Pro Tip: For precise targeting, use a frequency analyzer in your DAW to sweep and visualize notches/peaks.

Get better CPU function.
Consider modernizing the GUI.
